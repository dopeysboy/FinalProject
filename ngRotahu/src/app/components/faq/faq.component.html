        This website is a debt management tool to assist users in paying their debts in a way that saves them money from interest. It takes their monthly income, all monthly expenses they have, and with their residual income, calculates the best way they should pay their debt off. Because of the main functionality of paying off debts, it also has a secondary functionality of serving as a budgeting tool, to help users notate where their income from each month is going. Then, based on a user's calculated "Financial Fitness" score, it will serve them credit resources to navigate their current level of financial wellness.      </ng-template>

    <ngb-panel title="Built With">
      <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
        This application was built with Java, git, gihub, mySQL, SpringToolSuite, BootStrap, SpringBoot, css, html, Angular, and VS Code.
        During the production of this application, we used an agile development style and met daily during a scrum meeting. We also utilized a trello board for organizing tasking for this project. Finally, we followed a Continuous Integration Pipeline to better align with a real-world project.      </ng-template>

    <ngb-panel title="Things Learned">
      <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
        During production of this application, we learned how to more effectively use an agile development style and gained better understanding of how to use git for version management. As a team, we also gained proficiency in Angular.
        We continued to build our communication skills while working on this project--which has been the biggest project each of us has worked on thus far--and ensured that our product was functioning the way the entire team intended.      </ng-template>

    <ngb-panel title="Things To Do Next Time">
      <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
        Given more time with the project, we would have liked to better format the website with ngBootstrap to ensure the site had a more professional feel, and we would have liked to implement a soft credit check so users could get a better idea of their financial wellness.

    <ngb-panel title="Things Of Note">
      <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
        Of note, a lot of time was spent on the Debt Calculator functionality. It is a recursive function that recalculates the monthly payments if a debt is paid off before the set time limit (60 months). Another interesting function of the application is the FinancialFitness calculator--which takes in a user's incomes, expenses, and debts, and applies a fitness equation, similar to a machine learning algorithm--which is used in determining the credit resources served to the user.
